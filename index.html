<!--
    So next is whitespace,
    You may have noticed that all the text we have been working
    with are always on one line, no matter if we try it like this
-->

I am a very long line
and I need to be in more than one line.

<!--
    You will notice it is still printed on the same line
    if we view this in the browser. so make it go to the next line
    we will introduce a <br> -> break line tag
    like this:
-->

I am a very long line <br> and I need to be in more than one line.

<!--
    Now it is going to display as expected,
    You will notice tha <br> tag doesn't have a content of it own
    and a closing tag either. so it is another void tag.
-->

<!--
  We can all so break a line with the <p> tag
  like this
-->

<p> I am a very long line </p> and I need to be in more than one line.

<!-- We will talk more on this in the next exercise and differentiate between using the <br> and <p> -->
